		<p>Dhurandhar is an upcoming Hindi action–espionage thriller. The film is expected to revolve around covert intelligence operations, deception, and power struggles, exploring the grey areas of patriotism and morality. True to its title (which means cunning or strategist), the story focuses on sharp minds, hidden agendas, and high-stakes missions rather than straightforward heroics.</p>
